# Medical Percussion Robotics Research Project
This is the code repository containing all code and data for our medical percussion robotics research project.

## Paper 1
The project is split into 2 research papers. The first one is titled: **Design and Implementation of a Robotic Device for Medical Percussion**
and examines how we modelled the dynamics of medical percussion using Matlab and used this simulation to inform the design of a robotic percussion device. 
Video is available [here.][1]

## Paper 2
The second paper is titled **Acoustic Response Analysis of Medical Percussion using Wavelet Transform and Neural Networks** and details how we collected data from the previously developed percussion device and analysed the acoustic response using wavelet transform and neural networks.
