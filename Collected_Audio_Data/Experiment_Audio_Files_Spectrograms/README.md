## Automatic Spectrogram Generation

The audio files collected from the experiment were split using a Python script that detected periods of silence between taps. Coloured spectrograms were automatically generated for each percussion event and saved to this directory with a Python script. This provided training data for the neural network. Later these spectrograms would be replaced with grayscale scalograms.
