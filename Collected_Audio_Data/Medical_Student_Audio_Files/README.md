We extracted 282 individual percussion files from 18 original audio files. The original files were recorded on Feb 5, 2020. In them, a medical student performed percussion on:
- Human subject: lung, liver and abdominal areas
- Silicon subject: silicon, far from nodule or close to nodule (Liang's silicon sample - 2mm)  
The individual files can be found in the corresponding folders.
